Introduction
------------

This is a simple Lightroom export plugin, which attempts to reduce JPEG files
by using different lossless compression parameters on the exported file.

Currently, only OS X binaries are provided, as I don't have a working Windows 
environment available for development or testing.

Simply install the plugin and add the export filter in the Lightroom's export dialog.
You can also see some byte statistics in the plugin manager.
